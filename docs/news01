Subject: Providing Braille Quranic Script for Human Welfare Trust Institution, Pabna.

	With due respect I beg to state that Professor M. Abul Hossain, founder of Manab Kalyan Trust (Human Welfare Trust) has established a wonderful intuition at Singa under Pabna District in 1994. Till then among others as many as 27 blind students are studying Quranic and general education through Braille system. I personally visited this instruction and was impressed to observe their sincere and heart-felt efforts to educate blind students.
	They are in dire need of Braille Quranic scripts. Because these are published from Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. These are not available in Bangladeshi market. Because we do not have direct business transaction of such scripts with their countries.
	We shall be highly obliged if you Kindly forward our appeal to provide 20 seats of Braille Quranic scripts from each of the three embassies and oblige thereby.


Yours sincerely,

(Mohammad Shafiul Alam)
